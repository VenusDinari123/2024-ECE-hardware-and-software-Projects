# **ECE 115 Drone Lab Repository**

Welcome to the **ECE 115 Drone Lab Repository**, where you'll find various projects designed to demonstrate drone programming, navigation, and control using the Tello drone. Each lab focuses on different aspects of drone automation, interaction, and functionality, combining hardware control with software logic to create exciting and educational demonstrations.

---

## **Overview**

This repository contains several missions from our ECE 115 coursework, ranging from basic drone movements to advanced automated tasks and real-time control interfaces. Through these projects, you will learn how to:

- Establish and manage a connection with the drone.
- Automate flight paths for specific goals like navigation and photography.
- Control the drone in real time using GUI or keyboard inputs.
- Leverage advanced features such as video streaming, flips, and rotations.

## **Project Highlights**

### **Lab 4 - Flying in an Equilateral Triangle**  
- **Goal**: Program the drone to fly in a precise equilateral triangle pattern.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Takeoff and altitude adjustments.
  - Move forward and execute precise angular rotations to complete the triangle.
  - Land the drone safely after the flight.  

### **Lab 5 - Automated Navigation and Real-Time Control**
#### **Mission 1: Automated Aerial Photography and Navigation**  
- **Goal**: Automate a flight path to capture images of predefined points.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Record and stream live video during the flight.
  - Take high-resolution photos at strategic points.
  - Navigate with precise movements and rotations to explore the environment.  

#### **Mission 2: Real-Time Drone Control with Keyboard Input**  
- **Goal**: Enable manual drone control through keyboard inputs.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Control movements (up, down, forward, backward, left, right).
  - Execute advanced maneuvers like flips and rotations.
  - Record video and display real-time video streams.  

### **Lab 6 - GUI-Based Drone Control**  
- **Goal**: Create a user-friendly graphical interface for controlling the drone.  
- **Key Features**:
  - A 4x4 grid of buttons to perform various drone commands (takeoff, flips, altitude changes, etc.).
  - Monitor drone telemetry like battery status, height, and temperature.
  - Simplified interaction for beginners with visual controls.

### **Lab 7 - Mission Pad Detection**  
- **Goal**: Program the drone to detect and interact with mission pads autonomously.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Enable mission pad detection using the drone's downward-facing camera.
  - Perform specific actions based on pad IDs, such as executing flips for even-numbered pads.
  - Navigate and detect up to four mission pads along a linear path.

## **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ece115-drone-labs.git
   cd ece115-drone-labs
   ```

2. **Setup Instructions**:
   - Ensure you have access to a Tello drone and install the **TelloLib** library.
   - Configure your environment to support Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
   - Use a computer with Wi-Fi to connect to the drone.

3. **Run the Projects**:
   - Navigate to the respective lab folder and open the Java file.
   - Follow the instructions in the comments to execute the program.
